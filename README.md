# About The Project
The focus of this project was to create a web application featuring my biography and portfolio of completed assignments and projects. This responsive web application is able to render on multiple types of screen sizes for different devices. On the "About" page of my responisve portfolio, my biography, picture, and a link to my resume are displayed. On the "Portfolio" page, images of my top four assigmnets are display. The viewer simply clicks on the image, and it will lead them to the deployed like of the assignment's website. On the "Contact" page, 4 buttons are display to access my LinkedIn profile, Github profile, email, and phone number. It also has a contact form, so that users can fill it out and the form request will be sent directly to me.
